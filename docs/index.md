## BB84.Extensions

This library provides a set of extension methods for the .NET framework. For example, it includes methods to convert a `Color` to its RGB hexadecimal representation, to get the first day of the week, to iterate over an enumerable and execute an action on each element, take a random item from an array and much more.

## BB84.WinForms.Extensions

Even though it's getting on in years, I need a few extensions here and there to make working with WinForms easier and clearer.

This library provides a set of extension methods for the Windows Forms framework. For example, it includes methods to bind the text of a control or the visibility of a control to a property of a class, it contains bindings for data sources and the selected item of a combo box or list box and much more.
